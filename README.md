# Practical-RIS-Dual-Loop-Opt: Over-the-Air Computation via Practical Phase-Shift Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface

## Overview

This project implements and evaluates an Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp) system enhanced by a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS). Unlike ideal RIS models, this work employs a **practical phase-shift model** that captures the intrinsic amplitude-phase coupling of RIS elements. The primary goal is to minimize the Computation Mean Square Error (CMSE) by jointly optimizing user transmit coefficients, the access point (AP) receive factor, and the RIS reflection matrix.

The core of this project is a novel **dual-loop optimization framework**:
*   **Outer Loop**: Utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a near-optimal RIS reflection matrix.
*   **Inner Loop**: Employs an Alternating Optimization (AO) algorithm to iteratively optimize the transmit coefficients and the receive factor for a given RIS configuration.

## Key Results and How to Run

Our proposed dual-loop optimization algorithm demonstrates effective convergence and achieves superior performance in minimizing Computation Mean Square Error (CMSE) compared to traditional Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) methods, especially when considering the practical amplitude-phase coupling of RIS elements.

To run the experiments and reproduce the results, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the Python scripts located in the `expierements/` folder. For example:

```bash
python expierements/iteration.py
python expierements/compary_alog.py 
# and so on for other scripts like different_alpha.py, different_dB.py, stimulate_differnt_N.py
```

Below are some key figures from our simulations. The parameters for each figure can be found in `results/define.md`.

**1. Algorithm Convergence (MSE vs. Iterations)**
This figure shows the convergence behavior of our proposed GA-based algorithm compared to SCA and a random phase baseline. Our algorithm converges to a significantly lower MSE.

**2. Performance vs. Number of RIS Elements (MSE vs. N)**
Increasing the number of RIS elements (N) significantly reduces the MSE. Our GA-based approach consistently outperforms SCA.
